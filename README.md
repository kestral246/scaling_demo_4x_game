Scaling Demo 4x for Minetest
============================

![Screenshot](screenshot.png "Screenshot")

Based on Aug 31, 2019 commit of minetest_game. Created with the corresponding master branch version of minetest. When used with the stable-5 branch, errors about invalid background elements show up when using the inventory, but it still appears to work. No guarantees though.

**This is a technology demo to give an example of what happens when the player character is scaled up by 4x, which gives the effect of shrinking all the nodes to 1/4th their original size.**

To use this game with Minetest, place this repository in minetest/games directory.

**Notes and Cautions:**

* Must use Creative mode to get reasonable selection distance.

* Must turn off damageâ€”normal jumps at 4x physics cause fall damage.

* Vegetation has been disabled, since most plants are now too small.

* Caves and dungeons have also been disabled, since they're now too small to enter.

* Stairs and walls mods are no longer necessary, so have been deleted.

* The standard door is the only other item that has also been scaled by 4x.

* Basic terrain textures are scaled to maintain the look of the unscaled minetest game. Other textures will likely look too small.

* Mapgen parameters really need to be scaled and tuned to look right at 4x, but my attempts haven't turned out too well.

* No digging aids are currently provided. One could try the digall mod. Note that one original meter block is now 64 blocks, so digging and placing are now very tedious.



**Quarter node house example:**

I thought it would be interesting to show what can be done with smaller nodes, so I made a scale model of my house, with a full interior.

I have added the bakedclay mod to this game repo, to get more colors to play with, however I removed stairs and scaled the textures.
I also had to scale some more default textures and I needed to update the steel_door texture to get rid of the window.

I have included the schematic called schems/house_example.mts. To use, copy this file to worlds/yourworld/schems/house_example.mts and use your choice of schematic loading software, such as worldedit to load. **Warning: Only use this mts file with Scaling Demo 4x!**

However, make sure you have enough flat space before loading, it's dimensions are 50 x 79 nodes, and it's around 30 nodes tall.

**Lighting:** Minetest only propagates the light from lamps a short range, which makes it very difficult to light a room at 4x scaling. To help get around this I have provided the fill_light mod, which allows placing fill lights that can then be made invisible. See mods/fill_lights/README.md for details. When first placing fill lights I recommend setting 'smooth_lighting = false' to better understand how the lighting works.
